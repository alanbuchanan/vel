# Simple Browserify and Sass Setup

I found I was repeating this set up many times for when I just wanted a nice simple sandbox-type environement.

### Tools
- Gulp
- BrowserSync
- Gulp-Sass

### How to use

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `gulp` to start a localhost server.
3. Work with the files within `src`. Compiled SCSS lives in `src/css`.
